# Market-Segmentation
Market segmentation is a marketing strategy that involves dividing a broad target market into subsets of consumers who share common needs, characteristics, behaviors, or demographics. The goal of segmentation is to tailor marketing efforts and products to better meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment, thereby increasing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

In this project I am tasked with developing a customer segmentation to give recommendations like saving plans, loans, wealth management on target customer groups.
